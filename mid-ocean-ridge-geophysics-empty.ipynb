    "## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Mid-ocean ridges are the places where the oceanic crust and lithosphere are born. They are large mountain ranges in the deep ocean, stretching all around the globe and with heights rivaling that of the tallest mountains on land. Ridges are also a key part of plate tectonics, a major component of the biogeochemical cycle of the oceans, and the home of unique biological communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll study the **mid-ocean ridges through the lens of geophysics**. We'll use open geophysical data (gravity, bathymetry, lithospheric age) and open-source Python tools to try to answer questions like: \n",
    "\n",
    "* How do ridges stay so tall? \n",
    "* Are they in isostatic equilibrium? \n",
    "* Why do ocean basins get deeper as they age? \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll also learn how to translate into code the physical models of the cooling of the lithosphere so that we can compare their predictions with our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This tutorial was inspired by a computer-based practical lesson that I developed by the module *ENVS398 Global Geophysics & Geodynamics* of the University of Liverpool. Because of the Transform format, some of the more interactive components that I would do during a live in-person class were removed but there is still room for personal experimentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** See the GitHub repository <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i> <a href=\"https://github.com/compgeolab/transform2022\"><code>compgeolab/transform2022</code></a> for instructions on computer setup, following the tutorial, asking questions, etc. **I highly encourage everyone to experiment with the code here and explore the data in further detail** after the tutorial content is over."

    "* ETOPO1 should be fairly familiar to most people. What we'll be focusing on are the long stretches of shallow bathymetry in the oceans, like the one running in North-South in the middle of the Atlantic. These are the mid-ocean ridges.\n",
    "* Gravity is the absolute value of gravity measured at a constant height of 10 km above the WGS84 reference ellipsoid. By \"gravity\" we mean the combined \"gravitational\" and \"centrifugal\" accelerations. The overall pattern should be familiar to most geoscientists, with stronger gravity at the poles and weaker at the equator because of both the flattening of the Earth and the centrifugal component. Notice also the dim small-scale changes that accompany large mountain ranges and subduction zones.\n",
    "* Seafloor age, as expected, is younger at the mid-ocean ridges and progressively older as we move away from them. Most of the seafloor is between 0-150 Myr (a baby üë∂ by geological standards) with only small sections of older lithosphere.\n",

    "The first thing we'll do is investigate the **isostatic state** of the mid-ocean ridges. In other words, **are the ridges supported by their buoyancy (isostasy) or by other forces?** \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a job for gravity data! We know that **gravity disturbances should be very small and close to zero** in regions that are locally in isostatic equilibrium (following an Airy‚ÄìHeiskanen or Pratt‚ÄìHayford model). If they are in equilibrium, that means that the height of the ridges is supported mostly by their buoyancy. Since we know that ridges are where the oceanic lithosphere is being created, that buoyancy can't come from a low-density thick crustal root. So this would be **evidence for a lower density asthenosphere beneath the ridges**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's calculate the gravity disturbance globally to check this. The disturbance (usually shown as $\\delta g$ in books/papers) is defined as:\n",

    "$$ \\delta g (\\lambda, \\phi, h) = g (\\lambda, \\phi, h) - \\gamma  (\\lambda, \\phi, h) $$\n",

    "\n",
