# A geophysical tour of mid-ocean ridges

**Instructor:** [Leonardo Uieda](https://www.leouieda.com/)

Mid-ocean ridges are the places where the oceanic crust and lithosphere are
born.
They are large mountain ranges in the deep ocean, stretching all around the
globe and with heights rivalling that of the tallest mountains on land.
Ridges are also a key part of plate tectonics, a major component of the
biogeochemical cycle of the oceans, and the home of unique biological
communities.

In this tutorial, we'll study the mid-ocean ridges through the lens of
geophysics.
We'll use open geophysical data (gravity, bathymetry, lithospheric age) and
open-source Python tools to try to answer questions like:
How do ridges stay so tall?
Are they in isostatic equilibrium?
Why do ocean basins get deeper as they age?
Along the way, we'll also learn how to translate into code the physical models
of the cooling of the lithosphere so that we can compare their predictions with
our data.

This tutorial is aimed at learners with **intermediate level** coding knowledge.
We'll assume that learners have an understanding of variables, loops,
and functions as well as the basics of the Scipy stack (numpy and matplotlib).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è To do before the tutorial

Make sure you've done these things **before the tutorial on Thursday**:

1. Sign-up for the [Software Underground Slack](https://softwareunderground.org)
1. Join the channel `TBD`. This is where **all communication
   will happen**.
1. Set up your computer (instructions below). We will not have time
   to solve many computer issues during the tutorial so make sure you do this
   ahead of time. If you need any help, ask on Slack.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ For instructors

The tutorial is designed to be taught as a 2 hour session with **live-coding**.
To do so, create a copy of the notebook and delete all or most of the code
cells (it's OK to leave some in to allow more time in the tutorial).

Type in the code as you explain what you're doing. This will help you control
your pacing and avoid going too fast. It also opens up the opportunity for you
to make mistakes and teach students how to identify and solve them.

Ideally, have students follow along on their own computers, typing in the code
with you. Make sure you also share a copy of the pre-filled notebook with
students so that they can choose to not type and listen at the same time.
