## ‚ö†Ô∏è To do before the tutorial

Make sure you've done these things **before the tutorial on Thursday**:

1. Sign-up for the [Software Underground Slack](https://softwareunderground.org)
1. Join the channel `TBD`. This is where **all communication
   will happen**.
1. Set up your computer (instructions below). We will not have time
   to solve many computer issues during the tutorial so make sure you do this
   ahead of time. If you need any help, ask on Slack.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ For instructors

The tutorial is designed to be taught as a 2 hour session with **live-coding**.
To do so, create a copy of the notebook and delete all or most of the code
cells (it's OK to leave some in to allow more time in the tutorial).

Type in the code as you explain what you're doing. This will help you control
your pacing and avoid going too fast. It also opens up the opportunity for you
to make mistakes and teach students how to identify and solve them.

Ideally, have students follow along on their own computers, typing in the code
with you. Make sure you also share a copy of the pre-filled notebook with
students so that they can choose to not type and listen at the same time.
