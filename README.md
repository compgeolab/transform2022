# A geophysical tour of mid-ocean ridges

**Instructor:** [Leonardo Uieda](https://www.leouieda.com/)

Mid-ocean ridges are the places where the oceanic crust and lithosphere are
born.
They are large mountain ranges in the deep ocean, stretching all around the
globe and with heights rivalling that of the tallest mountains on land.
Ridges are also a key part of plate tectonics, a major component of the
biogeochemical cycle of the oceans, and the home of unique biological
communities.
   
**In this tutorial, we'll study the mid-ocean ridges through the lens of
geophysics.**
We'll use open geophysical data (gravity, bathymetry, lithospheric age) and
open-source Python tools to try to answer questions like:
How do ridges stay so tall?
Are they in isostatic equilibrium?
Why do ocean basins get deeper as they age?
Along the way, we'll also learn how to translate into code the physical models
of the cooling of the lithosphere so that we can compare their predictions with
our data.

## üßëüèø‚Äçüíª How to take part

**[Transform](https://transform.softwareunderground.org/) is an fully online event.**
You can participate either synchronously (live) or asynchronously (any time in the future).

### Synchronous:

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Before the tutorial** ‚ö†Ô∏è:
   1. Setup your computer (see below).
   1. Sign up for the [Software Underground Slack](https://softwareunderground.org).
1. Connect to the YouTube livestream at the tutorial time and hop on to the 
   `#t22-wed-mor-geophysics` channel on Slack as well.
1. Follow along with the tutorial on your computer (I'll write the code live).
   I'd recommend having your Jupyter notebook and the livestream side-by-side.
1. If you have any questions, post them on the Slack and we'll get to them.

### Asynchronous:

1. Setup your computer (see below).
1. Open the YouTube recording.
1. Follow along with the tutorial on your computer (I'll write the code live).
   I'd recommend having your Jupyter notebook and the livestream side-by-side.
1. If you have any questions, post them on the [Software Underground Slack](https://softwareunderground.org) 
   (make sure you mention which tutorial you're asking about).

## üë©‚Äçüéì Learner profile

This tutorial is designed with learners of the following profile. 

> **This does not mean that you need to fit this profile in order
> to take part**. It is meant only to communicate what is our starting point 
> for building out the content of the tutorial. 

* Undergraduate later in their studies or postgraduate in Earth Sciences.
* Has takes advanced level mathematics (summations, exponentials, trigonometric functions)
  and has had some exposure to calculus (differential equations).
* Is able to write Python code to analyze data, make figures, etc but not
  necessarily studied software development.
* Knows the basics of plate tectonic theory and global geology and geophysics,
  including the concept of isostatic equilibrium.

## üíª Computer setup

TBD

## üßë‚Äçüè´ For instructors

The tutorial is designed to be taught as a 2 hour session with **live-coding**.
To do so, create a copy of the notebook and delete all or most of the code
cells (it's OK to leave some in to allow more time in the tutorial).

Type in the code as you explain what you're doing. This will help you control
your pacing and avoid going too fast. It also opens up the opportunity for you
to make mistakes and teach students how to identify and solve them.

Ideally, have students follow along on their own computers, typing in the code
with you. Make sure you also share a copy of the pre-filled notebook with
students so that they can choose to not type and listen at the same time.
